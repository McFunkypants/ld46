# Ludum Dare 46
 
Ludum Dare 46 - a game made from scratch in 48hrs by McFunkypants.

The game jam theme is "KEEP IT ALIVE"

To add to the fun, I am using several limitations:

- no libs
- no engines
- no assets
- no old code

I am going to make everything from scratch, starting from a blank text file.
